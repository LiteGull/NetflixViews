# Netflix Views Organiser

This is a small script which makes understanding the view history a little easier.

It is simple to use, all you have to do is execute the Python file and it will
do the hard work for you.

### Prerequisites

- NetflixViewingHistory.csv (File downloaded from [here](https://www.netflix.com/viewingactivity).)
  Store this somewhere in the home directory.
- Python3

As long as the file downloaded from Netflix is called `NetflixViewingHistory.csv`
and is stored in the home directory then it will go to work.

Firstly, it will print out the amount of unique shows, then it will create a new
file in the same directory called `NetflixIndividualViewingHistory.csv`, in here
is a list of each individual show from the list.
